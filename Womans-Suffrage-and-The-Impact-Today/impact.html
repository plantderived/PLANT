<h2>Political Impact</h2>
  
<p>The 19th amendment was ratified on August 18, 1920. It granted women the right to vote and empowered women to have their voices heard in politics. After the 19th amendment was passed women no longer had to submit to the laws that were decided on by men.Not only that, but more opportunities for women economically were opened up. Similar movements that echo our event are the “black lives matter” movement which became popular after the incidents of people like George Floyd. Another similar movement is the “stop Asian hate” movement that emerged after the vicious hate crimes towards Asians that occured after the Corona Virus became prominent. Both these movements, much like the women’s suffrage movement that emerged after the Seneca Falls Convention, are fighting for equal treatment whether it be their rights or safety.</p>

<h2>How does this pertain to today?</h2>

<p>The convention is relevant today because it led to a domino effect of events that led to women's suffrage and equal rights. For example the Seneca Falls Convention prompted the women’s and civil rights movement that included women's suffrage. This accompanied with the 19th amendment, today there are women being appointed in congress and government positions. Women in the senate, for example, take up 25% of the 100 seats. Furthermore, the events toppled down the closing gap between men and women’s employment rates. This prompted operating companies, businesses, etc for gender-balance. Socially, women in men dominated fields are being more normalized in difference. For example the women’s force in World War II as the Women’s Land Army. This would continue to affect future generations as, not only are we still facing this fight and prompting more equality today, the convention and following movements inspire future generations to follow and bring back new advocates for important matters related to women’s suffrage.</p>
