<p>Beginning in the 19th century, people sought to change voting rights and granting women change. The Seneca Falls Convention was the first women's right convention in the United States of America. <b>Held on July 19, 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York, the convention has sparked the woman's suffrage movement.</b> During the convention, the <b>Declaration of Sentiments</b> was signed in 1848 by 100 out of 300 attendees that supported and ussued the rights of women including equality and suffrage. The public, mostly women, responded well and supported the advocacy of women's suffrage in response to the convention and document. Later into the future, the <b>National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), and National American Woman's Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was created after the nineteenth amendment</b>. These instances led to the impact of women suffrage association, action, and how it pertains to today's society.</p>
